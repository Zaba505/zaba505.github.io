I'm a self-taught developer with a curiousity to learn about anything,
from distributed systems to design systems and everything inbetween. Currently,
my main focus has been on the front-end, working with Vue.js.

When I'm not working, I enjoy just about any outdoor activity. And playing with
my cat!
