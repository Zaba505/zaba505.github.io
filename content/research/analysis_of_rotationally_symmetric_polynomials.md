### Abstract

Others have already studied the rotational symmetry
of the graphs of polynomial function. There approach
relied heavily on differential calculus. In this paper,
we focus on developing an algebraic based framework
to categorize the rotational symmetries of certain
functions. Then, conclude with an application of this
framework on the set of polynomial functions.
