calc.dev is an open-source project with the goal of porting all the functionality
of a TI-89 to a Progressive Web App.

The user interface is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and the computation
capabilities are implemented in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), which is then
compiled to [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org).
