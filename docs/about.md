title: About me
---

I’m a self-taught developer with a curiousity to learn about anything, from
distributed systems to design systems and everything inbetween. Currently, my
main focus has been on the front-end, working with Vue.js.

When I’m not working, I enjoy just about any outdoor activity. And hanging out
with my cat.
